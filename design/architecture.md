```

## Component Details

### 1. Core Engine

The central component that orchestrates the scanning process and manages the workflow.

**Responsibilities:**
- Initialize and configure the scanning environment
- Manage scanning sessions and state
- Coordinate between different modules
- Handle error recovery and logging
- Provide a unified API for CLI interaction

### 2. Scanner Controller

Manages the scanning process for different CMS platforms.

**Responsibilities:**
- Detect the CMS type from the target URL
- Load appropriate CMS-specific plugins
- Manage scanning workflow and sequence
- Control scanning depth and scope
- Handle rate limiting and request throttling

### 3. Detector Engine

Identifies vulnerabilities in the target CMS.

**Responsibilities:**
- Fingerprint CMS versions and components
- Match fingerprints against known vulnerabilities
- Detect misconfigurations and security issues
- Coordinate with AI module for enhanced detection
- Prioritize findings based on severity

### 4. Exploit Database

Maintains a repository of known vulnerabilities and exploits.

**Responsibilities:**
- Store CVE information and exploit details
- Provide an API for querying vulnerabilities
- Update vulnerability data from online sources
- Map detected issues to potential exploits
- Track exploit success probability

### 5. Reporter Module

Generates comprehensive reports of findings.

**Responsibilities:**
- Format scan results in various output formats
- Generate detailed vulnerability explanations
- Provide remediation suggestions
- Create executive summaries and technical details
- Support custom report templates

### 6. CMS Plugins

Modular components for scanning specific CMS platforms.

**Each plugin provides:**
- CMS-specific fingerprinting techniques
- Component enumeration methods
- Authentication mechanisms
- Custom scanning rules
- Platform-specific vulnerability checks

### 7. AI Enhancement Module

Leverages machine learning for improved vulnerability detection.

**Capabilities:**
- Pattern recognition for zero-day vulnerability detection
- Reduction of false positives
- Contextual analysis of configurations
- Adaptive scanning based on target behavior
- Exploit prediction and recommendation

## Data Flow

1. **Input Processing**:
   - User provides target URL
   - Scanner controller initializes scanning session
   - CMS type is detected automatically

2. **Reconnaissance**:
   - CMS plugin performs initial fingerprinting
   - Component enumeration (plugins, themes, modules)
   - Version detection and configuration analysis

3. **Vulnerability Detection**:
   - Detected components are matched against exploit database
   - AI module analyzes configurations for potential issues
   - Security misconfigurations are identified

4. **Exploit Matching**:
   - Identified vulnerabilities are mapped to known exploits
   - Exploit viability is assessed
   - Exploit details are prepared for reporting

5. **Reporting**:
   - Findings are collated and prioritized
   - Comprehensive report is generated
   - Remediation suggestions are provided

## Technical Implementation

### Language and Framework

- **Go** as the primary programming language
- Leveraging Go's concurrency model for efficient scanning
- Standard library for HTTP, JSON, and file operations
- Minimal external dependencies for better maintainability

### Module Communication

- Clear interfaces between components
- Event-driven architecture for flexibility
- Standardized message passing between modules
- Plugin system for extensibility

### AI Integration

- Embedded machine learning models for offline operation
- Optional API connections to cloud-based AI services
- Feature extraction from CMS responses
- Model training pipeline for continuous improvement

### Database

- Local SQLite database for vulnerability information
- JSON schema for exploit details
- Efficient indexing for quick lookups
- Automatic updates from online vulnerability databases

## Security Considerations

- Rate limiting to prevent DoS on target
- Secure handling of credentials and session data
- Ethical scanning practices built into core logic
- Clear audit logging of all operations
- Option to disable invasive tests

## Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be extensible in several ways:

1. **New CMS Support**:
   - Implement the CMS Plugin interface
   - Register the plugin with the scanner controller
   - Add CMS-specific fingerprinting and enumeration logic

2. **New Vulnerability Detectors**:
   - Implement the Detector interface
   - Register with the detector engine
   - Define detection logic and severity assessment

3. **Custom Report Formats**:
   - Implement the Reporter interface
   - Define template and formatting logic
   - Register with the reporter module

4. **Enhanced AI Capabilities**:
   - Swap or upgrade embedded models
   - Implement new feature extractors
   - Add specialized detectors for specific vulnerability classes

## Performance Considerations

- Concurrent scanning of multiple components
- Efficient resource utilization
- Caching of intermediate results
- Incremental scanning capabilities
- Resumable scans after interruption

## Future Expansion

- API server mode for integration with other tools
- Distributed scanning capabilities
- Real-time vulnerability database updates
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Expanded AI capabilities for predictive analysis
